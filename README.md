## About The Project

This project is part of the[Complete JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) course on Udemy, by Jonas Schmedtman. See my learning notes [here](https://github.com/iainaitken/courses/blob/main/udemy/complete_javascript/notes/section-7/070-guess-my-number.md).

The HTML and CSS files for the webpage were provided; the challenge was to implement the game logic using JavaScript. The features to be included in the app were:

- A random number between 1 and 20 is generated.
- The user attempts to guess the number by entering a number in the box, and clicking 'Check!'.
- If the number is too high or low, a message to that effect appears, and the user's score decreases by one.
- If the correct number is entered, the score is saved as a highscore, the number appears in the central box and the background turns green.
- Clicking on the 'Again!' button resets the game, but not the highscore.

In addition, I decided to include:

- Input validation; a guess outside the range 1-20, or a blank input, generate error messages.
- Background colour changes on an incorrect guess.

### Approach

My approach was to watch a demonstration of the features of the app and then attempt to implement the game logic without watching the course videos.

### Built With

- JavaScript

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

The app runs in a browser; one option of running it is to use live-server.

- npm

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

- live-server

  ```sh
  npm install -g live-server
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/iainaitken/repo_name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder

   ```sh
   cd repo_name
   ```

3. Start the server running

   ```sh
   live-server
   ```

## Usage

See [About the Project](#about-the-project) for an explanation of the game features, and how to play.

## Roadmap

Planned future features:

- Option of switching to a modern theme
- Persistent high-scores in local storage, with initials and date
